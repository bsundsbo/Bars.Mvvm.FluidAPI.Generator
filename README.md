# Bars.Mvvm.FluentApi.Generator
The goal of this project is to extend ActiproSoftware's [WPF-Library](https://github.com/Actipro/WPF-Controls) to offer a more simplified implementation of [bar menus](https://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/controls/wpf/bars) through Fluid extension methods and method chaining.

# Fluid API Features

* **[Fluent API](./Source/FluentApi.Generator/README.md)**: The fluid API allows you to create bar menus in a more declarative way, making it easier to read and maintain.
* **Chainable API**: The API is designed to be chainable, allowing you to build complex bar menus with minimal boilerplate code.
* **Convenience Methods**: The library provides convenience methods to simplify commonly used boilerplate code.

# Sample Application
See the [sample application](./Source/FluentApi.Wpf.Sample/README.md) for a demonstration of the features provided by this library.
