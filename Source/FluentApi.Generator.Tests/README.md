# FluidApi.Generator.Tests

## Unit test project for the FluidApi.Generator
This project contains unit tests for the FluidApi.Generator.

### TODO:
Since this started out as a proof of concept and a learning opportunity for Source Generators, the focus was initially on 
getting the hang of code generators. With the changing nature of the code as I learned more about the capabilities and 
limitations of the Roslyn API, the code has evolved too much during the process.

**This would normally have been done in TDD fashion, but going forward that is the plan.**

The following is a list of tests that need to be written:
- Write tests for FluidExtensionCodeGenerator
- Write tests FluidExtensionSourceGenerator
