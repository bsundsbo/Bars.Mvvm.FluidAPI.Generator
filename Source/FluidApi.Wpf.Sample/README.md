# Bars.Mvvm.FluidApi.Wpf.Sample

This project is a sample application displaying the usage of the following code generators, and how to use their output.

- [Bars.Mvvm.FluidApi.Generator](../FluidApi.Generator/README.md) - Generates extension methods for the Actipro WPF MVVM ViewModels to simplify the creation of Bar controls.
- [Bars.Mvvm.TemplateSelector.Generator](..\TemplateSelector.Generator\README.md) - Generates `DataTemplateSelector` and `ItemContainerTemplateSelector` for the Actipro WPF MVVM ViewModels.


# Needs to extend
* Extend with a more complete sample for constructing a complete Ribbon menu with backstage, footers and other parts to give a proper demonstration.
* Demonstrate more convenience methods when more of them are made available.
* Showcase the usage of the `DataTemplateSelector` and `ItemContainerTemplateSelector` generated by the `Bars.Mvvm.TemplateSelector.Generator`.
