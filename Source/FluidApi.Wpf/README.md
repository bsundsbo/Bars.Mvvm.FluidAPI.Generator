This project provided pre-generated code for the fluid API to simplify the creation of Actipro WPF Bars in MVVM for those who, for some reason, cannot or do not want to use the source generator in their project.
(If the package is available), I recommend using the source generator instead for better compatibility.

It is recommended to use the source generator instead of this package, as it will always generate to the current version of ActiproSoftware bars MVVM library and you won't have to worry about updating the NuGet package.
